# kth_gpa_calculator
Automate calculating your KTH GPA.

If you're too lazy to calculate your GPA yourself, just use this Python script and upload a PDF of your grade transcript. Any calculation produced by this program is never to be trusted.

Formulas from: https://www.kth.se/en/student/studier/utlandsstudier/utbyte/behorighet-och-urval-for-utbytesstudier-1.1090201
Courses which are only Pass/Failed are ignored because I cannot find how KTH measures those to GPA. 

The PDF can be downloaded in Ladok, this script expects the following parameters for the PDF:

- Official transcript of records:
Define: Courses within selected programme (select your program).
Language: English.
Include: remove all selections.

This is an alternative to https://betyg.kottnet.net/kth which requires your password (never give that out). It is also an alternative to just calculating it yourself (takes like 10 min).
